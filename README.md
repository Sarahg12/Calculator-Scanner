My attempt at implementing an ad-hoc scanner for a calculator language outlined in Chapter 2 of Programming Language Pragmatics (By Michael Scott)

WIP
===

TODO
---
+ Add support for comments
+ Create suite of tests
+ Figure out how to scan multi-line comments without pulling the entire file into memory
+ Add better debug information when a bad token is present (line/col info)
+ Modularize code into different files
