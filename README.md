My attempt at implementing an ad-hoc scanner for a calculator language outlined in Chapter 2 of Programming Language Pragmatics (By Michael Scott)

Features
---
+ Support for arbitrarily long lines
+ Small memory footprint -- only keeps single line in memory
+ When unrecognized token encountered, line and column number are printed
+ Unit tests run on pushes via Travis and Google C++ testing framework

TODO
---
+ Add better test coverage
