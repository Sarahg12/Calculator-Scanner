My attempt at implementing an ad-hoc scanner for a calculator language outlined in Chapter 2 of Programming Language Pragmatics (By Michael Scott)

WIP
===

Features
---
+ Support for arbitrarily long lines
+ Small memory footprint -- only keeps single line in memory

TODO
---
+ Create suite of tests
+ Add better debug information when a bad token is present (line/col info)
+ Modularize code into different files
